## Usage

### Basic Usage with Interactive Features

```typescript
import CalendarComponent from "@/modules/progress-hub/components/calendar";
import { createCalendarEvents } from "@/types/calendar";
import type { CalendarEvent } from "@/types/calendar";

// Create your events data
const events: CalendarEvent[] = createCalendarEvents([
  {
    id: "event-1",
    date: new Date(2025, 0, 15), // January 15, 2025
    title: "Assessment Session",
    description: "Cognitive skills assessment",
    time: "10:00 AM",
    duration: "2 hours",
    type: "assessment",
    priority: "high",
    color: "blue",
    status: "scheduled",
  },
  // ... more events
]);

// Use the component - days are automatically clickable
<CalendarComponent 
  events={events}
  initialDate={new Date(2025, 0, 1)}
  initialViewMode="stacked"
/>
```

### Interactive Behavior

#### **Clicking Empty Days**
- Opens a dialog to create a new event
- Pre-fills the date automatically
- Shows a clean form for event creation

#### **Clicking Days with Events**
- Shows all existing events for that day
- Click any event to edit it
- Option to add additional events
- Delete events with confirmation

#### **Visual Indicators**
- **Hover Effects**: Days highlight on hover
- **Mouse Pointer Icons**: Subtle indicators that days are clickable
- **Helper Text**: "Click days to manage events" in the header
- **Event Previews**: See event details on hover

### Event Dialog Features

#### **Conditional Content**
- **No Events**: Shows "Create Event" interface
- **Has Events**: Shows event list + "Add New" option
- **Editing**: Shows form pre-filled with event data

#### **Form Validation**
- Required fields marked with asterisks
- Real-time validation feedback
- Disabled save button until valid

#### **Event Operations**
- **Create**: Add new events to any day
- **Edit**: Modify existing event details
- **Delete**: Remove events with confirmation
- **Cancel**: Close without saving changes

## Component Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `events` | `CalendarEvent[]` | No | `[]` | Array of events to display |
| `initialDate` | `Date` | No | `new Date()` | Initial date to display |
| `initialViewMode` | `ViewMode` | No | `"stacked"` | Initial view mode |

**Note**: The component automatically handles event state management internally. Events passed via props are used as initial data, and the component maintains its own state for real-time updates.

### View Modes with Interactive Features

#### **Compact View**
- Shows events as colored dots
- Click anywhere on the day cell
- Hover shows mouse pointer icon

#### **Stacked View**
- Shows events as colored boxes with titles
- Click anywhere on the day cell
- Events are non-interactive (clicking the day opens dialog)

#### **Details View**
- Shows events in detailed cards
- Responsive grid layout (1 col mobile, 2 col tablet, 7 col desktop)
- Hover effects on entire day card
- "Click to add event" text for empty days

#### **List View**
- Shows all events in a vertical list
- Not clickable (events displayed chronologically)
- Good for overview of all monthly events

### Utility Functions

The `@/types/calendar` module provides utility functions:

```typescript
import { createCalendarEvent, createCalendarEvents } from "@/types/calendar";

// Create a single event
const event = createCalendarEvent({
  date: new Date(),
  title: "Test Event",
  time: "2:00 PM",
  type: "assessment",
  priority: "medium",
  color: "blue",
});

// Create multiple events
const events = createCalendarEvents([
  { /* event data */ },
  { /* event data */ },
]);
```

## Examples

### Complete Page Implementation

```typescript
// pages/schedule.tsx
"use client";

import { CalendarIcon } from "lucide-react";
import CalendarComponent from "@/modules/progress-hub/components/calendar";
import { createCalendarEvents } from "@/types/calendar";

const events = createCalendarEvents([
  // ... your events
]);

export default function SchedulePage() {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-4 sm:space-y-6">
      <div className="flex flex-col items-start gap-2">
        <h1 className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold flex items-center gap-2">
          <CalendarIcon className="h-6 w-6 sm:h-8 sm:w-8" />
          Assessment Schedule
        </h1>
        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
          Click on any day to create new events or edit existing ones
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <CalendarComponent 
        events={events}
        initialDate={new Date(2025, 0, 1)}
        initialViewMode="stacked"
      />
    </div>
  );
